This mod is intended to be played in the WATHE Modpack alongside other addon mods, like Stupid Express and Noelle's Roles, but it will work just fine without other addon mods installed.

## Roles
### **Starstruck** *[Civilian]*
- Become *Starstruck* once every 90 seconds.
- While *Starstruck*, move faster and see players through walls with passive instinct- but your role will be revealed to everyone nearby!
- Shorten your ability cooldown by 5 seconds every time you complete a task.

## Decoration
### Plushies!
Currently the only plushie added by the mod is the **Stargazer Plushie**, a plushie of my Wings of Fire OC!
I plan to add more plushies of my friends soon! Stay tuned for that :3
